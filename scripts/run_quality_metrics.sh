## Recommendations

- Functions with complexity >10 should be reviewed for refactoring
- Consider breaking down complex functions into smaller, more focused functions
- Use early returns and guard clauses to reduce nesting
- Extract common logic into helper functions

## Linter Configuration

The project uses golangci-lint with the following modern linters:

- **revive** (replaces deprecated golint)
- **unused** (replaces deprecated deadcode, structcheck, varcheck)
- **exportloopref** (replaces deprecated scopelint)
- **staticcheck** for advanced static analysis
- **govet** for Go compiler checks
- **errcheck** for error handling verification

## Running Linting

\`\`\`bash
# Run linting locally
golangci-lint run

# Or using Docker
make quality-docker
\`\`\`

# Performance Metrics

> Last updated: $(date)

## Build Performance

- **Build Time**: ${BUILD_TIME}s
- **Binary Size**: ${BINARY_SIZE}
- **Test Execution Time**: ${TEST_TIME}s

## Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Build Time | <5s | ${BUILD_TIME}s | $(if (( $(echo "$BUILD_TIME < 5" | bc -l) )); then echo "‚úÖ PASS"; else echo "‚ö†Ô∏è SLOW"; fi) |
| Test Time | <10s | ${TEST_TIME}s | $(if (( $(echo "$TEST_TIME < 10" | bc -l) )); then echo "‚úÖ PASS"; else echo "‚ö†Ô∏è SLOW"; fi) |
| Binary Size | <20MB | ${BINARY_SIZE} | $(if [[ "${BINARY_SIZE}" =~ ^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+M$ ]] && (( $(echo "${BINARY_SIZE%M} < 20" | bc -l) )); then echo "‚úÖ PASS"; else echo "‚ö†Ô∏è LARGE"; fi) |

## Performance Trends

Regular monitoring of these metrics helps identify performance regressions:

- Monitor build time trends
- Track binary size growth
- Optimize test execution
- Profile performance bottlenecks

## Optimization Tips

### Build Time
- Use Go module proxy for faster dependency resolution
- Optimize Docker build layers
- Use build caching

### Test Performance
- Use parallel test execution
- Optimize test setup/teardown
- Use test fixtures efficiently

### Binary Size
- Use build constraints for optional features
- Strip debug information for production builds
- Use UPX compression if needed
